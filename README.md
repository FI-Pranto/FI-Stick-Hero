# ðŸªµ Stick Hero (Unity)

Stick Hero is a simple yet challenging Android game inspired by the original "Stick Hero". The goal is to grow a stick to the perfect length so the player can cross from one platform to the next. Built with Unity, this project was created as a learning exercise in game physics, input handling, and scene management.
